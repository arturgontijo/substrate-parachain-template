//! # Simple Oracle Pallet (Offchain Worker Example Pallet based)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Offchain Worker (OCW, to fetch data from http API) will be triggered after every block,
//! fetch the current price and prepare an unsigned transaction to feed the result back on chain.
//! The on-chain logic will simply aggregate the results and store last `T::MaxPrices` values
//! to compute the average price.
//!
//! Additional logic in OCW is put in place to prevent spamming the network with
//! unsigned transactions, and custom `ValidateUnsigned` makes sure that there is only
//! one unsigned transaction floating in the network.
